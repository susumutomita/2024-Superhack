## What is Senryu

**Senryu (川柳)** is a type of Japanese short poem like a haiku but focuses more on human nature and everyday life. It has a 5-7-5 syllable pattern and often includes humor or irony.

## What We Made

**Onchain Senryu**: A decentralized platform for creating, submitting, and voting on Senryu poems. Blockchain technology ensures transparency and authenticity, while AI assists in generating Senryu based on user input.

---

## How It Works

- **Create Senryu**:
  1. Users input a theme or prompt in English.
  2. The AI generates a Senryu in Japanese.

- **Submit & Vote**:
  1. The generated Senryu is submitted to the blockchain.
  2. The community votes, with votes securely recorded on the blockchain.

---

## Why We Made It

To preserve the traditional art of Senryu in a modern digital context, making it accessible to a global audience while ensuring authenticity and ownership through blockchain technology.

---

## Demo

- Authentication using World ID
- Live demonstration of creating and submitting a Senryu, and an overview of the voting process.

## Tech Stacks

- **Frontend**: Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Blockchain**: Solidity, Foundry, Base blockchain
- **AI**: Groq API for Senryu generation
- **Authentication**: World ID for secure user verification and bot prevention
- **Vote Ranking**: Latest rankings powered by Goldsky, based on community votes.
